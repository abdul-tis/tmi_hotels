Close by, the looming figure of Jebel Hafeet signifies the country’s second tallest peak, and Al Ain tour guides often recommend taking the hair-raising drive to the top, if only to relax in the bubbling springs of the Green Mubazara Park. And amidst the town’s districts, visitors can explore bustling Arab souks laden with livestock and local textile productions, the city’s historic fort-come-museum complex, and seemingly endless swathes of date palms that offer shady avenues around the Oasis.</p>', 1, 0, 2, '24.23', '55.74', 'al-ain', 0, 1),

Let an experienced Arequipa Travel guide navigate you through the Roman Catholic churches that dot the city like the large La Compania Church and Cloister, her finely carved arched columns and ornate entrance is most probably the most beautiful in the city. Spend a few hours at the Convento de Santa Catalina, walking through the Cloister of the Oranges, the beautiful silverwork of the Alter of the church or walk along Cordova Street, geraniums hanging from the window boxes. Crossing the iron bridge Puente Fierro, it would be appropriate to stop for lunch and try the traditional Rocoto relleno con pastel de papa, a pepper that has been stuffed with potato pie.</p>\n', 1, 0, 167, '-16.39', '-71.53', 'arequipa', 0, 1),

When to go? Spring and summer visits come with plentiful vines, bursting in bloom after the winter&rsquo;s late rains. The arrival of fall brings harvest season with it, and the foliage turns into dazzling autumn colors while the grapes are gathered. Live music, festivals, and subsequent crowds are most common June through the October, while winter brings just as picturesque surroundings with far less travellers. To escape the tourist prices and avoid colder weather, April and November are ideal months for budget-friendly travel to Napa&rsquo;s wine, food, and indulgence.&nbsp;</p>\n', 1, 0, 220, '38.30', '-122.30', 'napa', 0, 1),

A suburb of the San Francisco Bay Area, Dublin lies just 35 miles east of San Francisco and makes up one third of California&rsquo;s picturesque Tri-Valley. While wine-lovers head to Livermore Valley for the state&rsquo;s oldest wine region, history buffs and foodies cherish the nearby historic downtown districts of Danville and Pleasanton. With mild average temperatures of 68 degrees, the Tri-Valley area&rsquo;s beautifully manicured golf courses attract tourists year round. For many, Dublin, CA is a closer-to-home dose of Ireland and beloved weekend getaway.</p>\n', 1, 0, 220, '37.72', '-121.91', 'dublin-california', 0, 1),

Beautiful palaces, ornately decorated temples and expansive green parks overlook impressive high rises and the hustle and bustle of thousands of pedestrians on the boulevards and narrow alleyways. A predominantly mandarin speaking populace entails the need for the experience and interpretative skills of a Beijing Travel Guide. Start your sightseeing with a day trip to The Great Wall of China, an awe inspiring architectural wonder of the ancient world. The Palace Museum otherwise known as the Forbidden City hosts one of the largest museums in Asia, enthralling with its red pagoda buildings surrounded by vast pathways, magnificent gardens. Reaching high into the sky, the multiple round roofs of the Temple of Heaven beckon for a visit, as do the lake and lush gardens of the Summer Palace before being brought back to the structural magnificence of the present at the Olympic Stadium, fondly called the Bird Cage. Join the many locals in the Hutong area as they practice Tai Chi, dance, practice their calligraphy or just relax over a game of mah-jong. This may be an opportune time to participate in a tea tasting or enjoy a well-deserved foot massage before heading to a traditional gastronomic feast of Peking duck.</p>\n', 1, 0, 45, '39.93', '116.40', 'beijing', 0, 1),

Secondly, it’s the birthplace of that much-loved Bolognese sauce, and is now hailed as the veritable culinary capital of the nation.

And we haven’t even started on the museums and art galleries yet—go ahead and ask your Bologna tour guide for those! Indeed, so versatile is beautiful Bologna that it has something for virtually every type of traveller. People watchers can mingle with the crowds around the fountain of Neptune on Piazza Maggiore, and partiers can join the students in the Via Zamboni.

Probably one of the most exciting adventures is the Brno Underground, a phenomenal labyrinth of corridors, cellars and crypts. Let your Brno travel guide lead you into exploring these medieval corridors where the cold starkness and serene quietness is a pleasant relief from the hubbub of the streets above.&nbsp; The architecture of the city is spectacular and diverse; from the gothic towers and baroque interiors of the cathedral of St Peter and St Paul that grace the city skyline to the iconic modern lines of Villa Tugendhat, a World Heritage site. The architectural and religious heritage of this Moravian capital showcased by churches, castles and monasteries is complemented by culture, an important facet of Czech life. The imposing but statuesque Mahen Theatre, built in 1881, was the first theatre in Europe that installed Thomas Edison&rsquo;s electric light bulbs. To bring it all together, leafy parks abound and restaurants and sidewalk cafes provide pleasant relief from all the walking; choose any one to try out an assortment of delicious and beautifully crafted pastries and aromatically fragranced coffee.&nbsp;</p>\n', 1, 0, 53, '49.20', '16.61', 'brno', 0, 1),

Home to the endangered Royal Bengal tiger, this virgin forest offers the adventurous traveller a seemingly unending network of trees and wildlife. Your Khulna Travel guide will navigate you through clusters of islands separated by meandering rivers and streams to catch glimpses of crocodiles, monkeys, deer and different species of birds amongst others, all blending harmoniously in their natural habitat.</p>\n', 1, 0, 18, '22.84', '89.56', 'khulna', 1, 1),

For many, Morogoro is the perfect pit stop to rest their eyes and eat some local grub before engulfing themselves in the mountains. A good Morogoro tour guide will lead you on an eye-catching safari and hiking expedition among the Waluguru Tribe, who call the mountain home. Keep in mind that hiking Uluguru without a guide can be dangerous, and muggings or robberies are not uncommon for the lone traveler. Swahili is the commonly spoke language, and knowing the dialect can be helpful both on the mountain and navigating your way through town.<br />\n	With a grass landing strip and no scheduled flight, traveling to Morogoro via train, bus or car is far more realistic. Mini buses, known as daladalas, are common modes of transportation and leave from the center of town once they are full. Taxis and motorbikes are equally reliable ways to get around Morogoro, and see all that this suburban African city has to offer. &nbsp;</p>\n', 1, 0, 217, '-6.82', '37.66', 'morogoro', 0, 1),

The escarpment creates its own milder climate, thus conducive to fruit growing, the produce being available aplenty at Farmers Markets in the city.<br />\n	There are many museums and memorials in Hamilton including the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum, the Museum of Steel and Technology, and the Canadian Football Hall of Fame.&nbsp; Your Hamilton Tour Guide may spook you into signing up for the popular Haunted Hamilton Ghost Walks for&nbsp; a supernatural experience in the city.&nbsp;</p>\n', 1, 0, 35, '43.26', '-79.85', 'hamilton', 0, 1),

With so many things on offer, the expertise of a Puntunarenas Travel Guide will keep you busy all day long. The small old town which bears testament to the beginnings of the now large city has a beautiful church called the Catedral Puntarenas. Walk through the entrance in Sagrado Corazon de Jesus urban park, and you will be overwhelmed by the tall imposing pillars, curved ceilings and long stained glass windows. The many beach front cafes offer delicious fresh platters of sea food or have a smoothie before catching the ferry to Jaco, where one is able to hike through the bio-diverse Pacific Rain Forest or take an Aerial Tram through the tree tops. Snorkel amongst the colourful tropical fishes, go horseback riding or hire a mountain bike to ride along the beaches and on the mountains trails. February is the time of the Puntarenas Carnevales as the brightly coloured floats and people dressed in ornate headgear and costumes parade and dance through the streets.

It&rsquo;s a place of traditional pubs complete with roaring fires, home to the soaring sandstone Inverness Castle, and one of the country&rsquo;s best Titanic museums.<br />\n	All around town, the acclaimed backcountry of the Great Glen rises in hills and snow-tipped mountain ridges, representing one of the most celebrated outdoorsy destinations in the country; a veritable playground for canoers, hikers, bikers and wild campers looking to taste the cold breezes of the north, or seek the legendary Loch Ness Monster in its mythical home.<br />\n	But while wild and remote even for a Scottish city, as any Inverness tourist guide will tell you, this spot on the Moray Firth still has a modern edge. For one it&rsquo;s hailed as one of the most liveable spots on all of the Islands, while it&rsquo;s steadily been edging towards economic boom in recent years, attracting students and workers from across Europe to its research institutions and all-new medical enterprises.</p>\n', 1, 0, 74, '57.49', '-4.24', 'inverness', 0, 1),

It was here in the 13th and 14th centuries that William Wallace and the highland nobles first asserted Scottish independence, and the place the Jacobites bunkered down and launched their skirmishes against the powers to the south.<br />\n	Today, the Stirling castle that once housed their guns and men still looms large, commanding the Stirling plain. It&rsquo;s the kingpin of what locals call &lsquo;the top of the town&rsquo;; a charming conglomeration of rough stone streets and earthy Scottish homes that have lingered on this crag for centuries, and best explored by visitors along the scenic Back Walk. Be sure to ask your Stirling tourist guide about the town&rsquo;s other main sights; from Argyll&#39;s Lodging to the notorious Stirling Bridge under the shadow of the Wallace monument.<br />\n	But Stirling is not all for history buffs either, as one discovers at the arts and performance hub of Tolbooth. Further, this town on the cusp of the highlands offers outdoor enthusiasts fantastic access to the serene Trossachs National Park and Loch Lomond, where loch lakes rub shoulders with sheltered forests, and sylvan valleys linger in the mist beneath snow-tipped peaks.</p>\n', 1, 0, 74, '56.12', '-3.94', 'stirling', 0, 1),

If it&rsquo;s this cultural past that interests you, then be sure to ask your Kunming tourist guide for directions to the 1000-year-old Yuantong Temple in the north of the city, unquestionably the most significant Buddhist worship site in the region.<br />\n	Away from the cosmopolitan city centre, replete with skyscrapers and wide roads, the rugged gorges and mountainsides of Yunnan make up the other half of Kunming&rsquo;s touristic offering. Excursions run throughout the year to the nearby Tiger Leaping Gorge, the fantastic geological formations of the Stone Forest and dramatic hoodoo gardens of the so-called Yuanmou Earth Forest.</p>\n', 1, 0, 45, '25.05', '102.70', 'kunming', 0, 1),

At its heart, visitors will find a surprisingly well-to-do grid of criss-crossing roadways threaded with neat cottages sporting shiny corrugated roofs, a place oddly apart from the ethereal and mist-clad Mahabharata mountain peaks that loom on the horizon.

It subsequently rose to great prominence as the summertime capital of the Madras Presidency, famed for its breezy and temperate position amidst the rolling highlands of the south. </p><p class="fr-tag" style="text-align: justify;">Today, Ooty continues to draw crowds; and while its bustling town centre may seem too busy for those who come in search for the mysterious stillness of a hill station, head further to step out to its verdant domain in the district of Nilgiris. The rewards are exquisite post-colonial mansions, endless grounds of cultivated English gardens, more than a smattering of mysterious Hindu temples, and breath-taking surroundings of pine-clad mountain peaks, aromatic tea gardens and blooming thickets of Indian teak trees. </p><p class="fr-tag" style="text-align: justify;">Back to the old town, its pretty hillside lanes are accessed by Ooty’s iconic miniature steam train and encompassed by the neat hedgerows and colourful flowerbeds of the Government Botanical Gardens. Ooty tour guides also recommend exploring the scintillating waters of the region’s various lakes, before sitting back to sample a brew of the local tea along with a snack of pakodas at one its many scenic points.</p>', 1, 0, 100, '11.42', '76.69', 'ooty', 0, 1),

Decades earlier, American Indians departed from Chattanooga&rsquo;s Ross&rsquo;s Landing and thus began the Cherokees departure west, known as the Trail of Tears. This historic land now serves as a go-to destination, ripe with sites of antiquity, outdoor adventures, and cultural offerings perfectly tailored for a family getaway or romantic weekend.<br />\n	Any good Chattanooga tour guide will suggest you try a piece of everything this southern city has to offer, but it&rsquo;s not such an easy feat. The mountainous lookout points, old-fashioned train rides, military roots, and performing arts offerings create a deeply historic city thrust into today&rsquo;s world with grace, beauty, and a neighborhood-like comfort.&nbsp;</p>\n', 1, 0, 220, '35.07', '-85.26', 'chattanooga', 0, 1),

This shell shaped city square is beautifully laid out at the heart of the town;&nbsp; it&rsquo;s casual ambience of&nbsp; cafes, shops and the lovely &ldquo;fonte Gaia&rdquo; provide a welcome break from visiting the palaces, museums and churches around, the star attraction being the Duomo at the Siena Cathedral complex nearby.<br />\n	Food, like in any Italian city is an integral part of Siena&rsquo;s culture. Surprisingly uncorrupted by the modern influence, one can look forward to local delicacies of&nbsp; &ldquo;Cinta Seneses&rdquo; made of wild boar that along with hare make for delicious crostini. Supplement your gastronomical exuberance with a glass of locally brewed Tuscan wine, and a late night Passegiata (stroll) under the stars to complete the sublime experience that is Siena.&nbsp;</p>\n', 1, 0, 104, '43.33', '11.32', 'siena', 0, 1),

And if you are in Vilnius around April Fools Day, visit the Uzupis District for a fun filled experience lead by artists and creative minds.&nbsp;</p>\n', 1, 0, 127, '54.70', '25.27', 'vilnius', 0, 1),

Any good travel guide to Hong Kong begs to mention its world-renowned cuisine, edgy urban scene and strange sense of ease about the locals. This is a sensory city evocative of drama and ambition, and a perfect destination for anyone yearning to experience some excitement.</p>\n', 1, 0, 91, '22.32', '114.17', 'hong-kong', 0, 1),

The Old Town&rsquo;s streets sport western bars, cafes and restaurants galore in addition to local fare and many a souvenir shop. A further testament to the city&rsquo;s historical significance is the Three Pagodas of Chongsheng Temple, 1200-year-old Buddhist structures at the base of the Erhai Lake Village.

Today, the site attracts millions of visitors a year, who come to catch a snapshot of provincial Roman life between the archways of the Temple of Hadrian, the mosaicked floors of the affluent Terrace Houses, the piazzas of Domitian’s Square and the dilapidated rises of the old worshipping rooms.

All other times, the vast park continues to scintillate with some amazing game viewing; timeless dances of survivals between the hunters and hunted, and roaming herds of assorted animals clustered around the region’s sporadic waterholes, not to miss an equally impressive array of birds and members of the insect Dom. </p><p class="fr-tag" style="text-align: justify;">And once you’re done tracking them all across the African plains, why not ask your Serengeti tour guide about doing something altogether different, like soaring above the Serengeti on a hot air balloon tour, or getting your hit of human heritage by meeting some of the tribal bushmen of Tanzania’s outback and the Great Rift Valley.</p>', 1, 0, 217, '-2.20', '34.34', 'serengeti-national-park', 0, 1),

(2, 'United Arab Emirates', 'AE', '971', '<p style="text-align: justify;">\n	A fantasy destination in every sense of the word, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) stand as a testament to the past, present and future of the Middle East. When you consider its economic, cultural and historical contributions, its safe to say the seven emirates that make up this country are nothing less than rich.<br />\n	Alongside the countries of Saudi Arabia and Oman, two gulfs bind in this tiny nation: the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. Skyline, sand and sea dominate its ever-changing landscape, just as its star cities - Abu Dhabi and Dubai - dominate world headlines. Stylish yet strict, these Islamic cities are ever on the cusp of the new (and even kooky), easily representing the possibilities of Arabian life in the East.<br />\n	Travel guides to the United Arab Emirates will all allude to its prominence as a well-rounded vacation spot. Whether the notion of an exotic camel ride under a star-studded sky or a historic tour of the heritage sights has you booking a flight here; either way you won&rsquo;t be sorry you did.</p>\n', 1, 'united-arab-emirates', 0, 1),
(3, 'Afghanistan', 'AF', '93', '<p style="text-align: justify;">\n	Emerging from more than thirty years of war and conflict, it&rsquo;s perhaps hard to imagine any county with a recent past more traumatic and tumultuous than Afghanistan. Its unlikeliness as a viable travel destination today has been bolstered by the continued warnings of international agencies, while any journalist will tell you that the situation on the ground is far from ideal.<br />\n	That said, Afghanistan&rsquo;s wealth of supreme natural beauty have done well to bring it a little closer to the intrepid traveller&rsquo;s fold in recent years, and the vast highlands at Koh-i-Baba and the Hindu Kush are once again slowly opening their doors to the most daring of hikers.<br />\n	What&rsquo;s more, the country is still home to a veritable array of different religious hotspots, from the somewhat emotional and culturally loaded ruins at Bamiyan (where the grand 6th century Buddha statues were destroyed so unceremoniously by the Taliban in 2001) to the azure fa&ccedil;ade of the Shrine of Hazrat Ali in the Islamic pilgrimage city of Mazar-i-Sharif.&nbsp;</p>\n', 1, 'afghanistan', 1, 20),

With little influence of outside politics or culture, progressiveness meets antique authenticity in this Balkan country. Amidst trendy nightclubs and modern city lights, the charming beauty of Albania&rsquo;s natural and historical backdrop creates an atmosphere unlike any other place. The Ionian coast boasts blissful beaches, and the cities of Vlore and Sarande are can&rsquo;t-miss seaside getaways with Albanian flair; take a ferry to Italy or stroll the shoreline beneath the Balkan sunset. Meanwhile, the country&rsquo;s Northern provinces keep its&rsquo; ruggedly native personality thriving, where ancient castle ruins sit among colossal mountains.<br />\n	As any Albania tour guide will tell you, the local culture pulses through every region of this proud country and leaves visitors with a distinct taste of their spirit and flavor. Speaking of flavor, don&rsquo;t end your trip without a thick Albanian stew, homemade bread, and local raki &lsquo;cocktail&rsquo;.

(7, 'Armenia', 'AM', '374', '<p style="text-align: justify;">\n	Armenia is a gem of the Eurasian Caucasus and one of the most widely-recognised geographical gateways from Eastern Europe to the continent of Asia. Noticeably landlocked betwixt on the highlands of Turkey and Azerbaijan, its inland ranges are some of the most dramatic in the region, finding their pinnacle at the stratovolcano of Mount Aragats just north of the capital and opening up a myriad of forests and rugged valleys where visitors can hike and explore without end.&nbsp;<br />\n	Most Armenia tourist guides will point you to the much-visited lakeside town of Sevan, or the culturally-loaded capital of Yerevan, while others may recommend a number quieter, more off-the-beaten-track sights, like the smattering of quaint villages that cluster around the Debed River canyons, or the onion-domes and old Russian homesteads of Gyumri in the north.<br />\n	Whatever you do, be sure to sample the famous Harissa wheat-meat porridge that&rsquo;s made super fresh in the more remote corners of the country, and don&rsquo;t leave without tasting the regional Oghi vodka (preferably one not brewed by the backcountry moonshiners!).</p>\n', 1, 'armenia', 0, 1),

(9, 'Antarctica', 'AQ', '672', '<p style="text-align: justify;">\n	The coldest, driest, wildest, iciest and most inhospitable continent on the planet is a plethora of superlatives like no other. Governed by the whim of the most basic elemental forces, Antarctica&rsquo;s apocalyptic ice shelves and glacial deserts span more than 14 million square kilometres of the world&rsquo;s most southerly territory, enshrining its rocky surface in vast ice sheets more than one kilometre thick.<br />\n	For the most part humans never venture here, and save a few thousand impermanent inhabitants the land is left to the penguin packs, blubbery seals and majestic snowy albatross colonies. What&rsquo;s more, with temperatures recorded here in excess of -89 degrees Celsius, the wildest and most inaccessible swathes of the land are largely unreachable; a place where few, if any, have ventured before.<br />\n	But, for the most intrepid explorer types, this alien world remains one of the most-coveted of worldly destinations, where free from the politics of borders and the crowds of mass tourism, people can follow in the footsteps of Scott, McMurdo and Ross. If that sounds like you, then be sure to ask your Antarctica tourist guide for tips on the various research stations and trekking excursions that can take you deep into the ice shelves and glacial valleys of the continent.</p>\n', 1, 'antarctica', 0, 1),

It would be hard to address all the attraction that makes this Latin American country the dream destination it has become, but an effort will be made regardless.<br />\n	First, and most importantly, the food and drink; homemade wine overflows from fresh, locally grown grapes that make wine tours and tastings a trip on its&rsquo; own. This homegrown spirit pairs well with the nation&rsquo;s world-revered beef, empanadas, and pastries. As any Argentina tour guide will remind you, lunch is often a huge meal with dinner eaten very late at night.<br />\n	So what to in between these standard eating times? Argentina&rsquo;s photo-worthy landscapes are enough to fill an entire week&rsquo;s time. The powerful Andes offer high deserts and scenic lakes, the Iguazu Falls rival Niagara&rsquo;s, while a horse ride through Glaciers National Park is an experience too majestic to skip. Festivals, the fiery tango and shops overtake the rest of the region, beckoning tourists to explore every corner of the country with eagerness and pleasure. &nbsp;</p>\n', 1, 'argentina', 0, 1),

Scenes from The Sound of Music; the stereotypical images of Austria run deep through the minds of foreigners, but hardly scrape the surface of this country&rsquo;s true identity. A landscape of high mountain peaks and deep, lakeside valleys create a natural playground for skiers, swimmers and hikers. Take in Austria&rsquo;s natural beauty with a picnic in the deep greenery or cable car ride through the glistening highlands. Amidst those picturesque sites are vast vineyard regions, producing local wines as much a part of the culture as the Austrian people. For natives, a commitment to food and wine is an intricate part of their lifestyle; gourmet shops, sidewalk cafes, and wine taverns await all who visit.<br />\n	Beyond the cuisine, Austria&rsquo;s culture, as is exemplified by its heritage, is heavily intertwined with the arts. Opera, theater, and classical music make the country&rsquo;s heartbeat, with an explosion of energy and virtuosity. Any Austria tour guide will tell you that Vienna has long since been the cultural epicenter of the nation, drawing in eager vacationers and adventurous backpackers by the masses.</p>\n', 1, 'austria', 0, 1),

The urban areas sprinkled along this coastline play home to a majority of its local population, whose multicultural mix is delightfully characterized by a laid back lifestyle gravitating towards the outdoors, and a unique brand of colloquial language.<br />\n	Sydney promises high-end nightlife and sun soaked beaches; make a detour to Melbourne for a cultured dose of the arts. A visit to Perth promises access to some of the world&rsquo;s best wines from the Margaret River while Brisbane&rsquo;s caf&eacute; culture sets the mood to encounter a whole new underwater world at the Great Barrier Reef.<br />\n	And while there are so many more cities to explore, your Australia tour guide will tell you that the country&rsquo;s lure doesn&rsquo;t stop when you leave its&rsquo; urban shores. The vast inland is a treasure trove; best unpacked via four-wheel drive treks off the beaten path. This is where you get to experience the spirituality of its Red centre through Aboriginal eyes and drive through what is truly the quintessential open road, to discover ever secluded breathtaking landscapes where native animals roam and nature thrives in its&rsquo; purest form.</p>\n', 1, 'australia', 0, 1),

Here, from the multicultural capital of Baku, to the high traditionalism of the southern Talish hills, visitors are treated to a montage of old and new cultures, the intermingling of which is at the very heart of modern Azerbaijani culture.<br />\n	Of the &lsquo;must sees&rsquo; and &lsquo;must dos&rsquo;, the UNESCO-attested old town of the country&rsquo;s capital Baku is perhaps the most recommended by Azerbaijan tour guides; it&rsquo;s home to the stunning Maiden&rsquo;s Tower, a king pin of local folk legends and Arabic lore, along with the sprawling Palace of the Shirvanshahs &ndash; a Middle Age relic of regional power. Further to the north, the city of Khachmaz represents one of the local-favourite holiday spots, where visitors can enjoy the warm beaches of the Caspian coast and sprawling forests of the Caucus backcountry in the same day.<br />\n	Azerbaijan is also famed for spanning no fewer than nine separate climactic zones, and offers a palimpsest of snow-covered peaks, volcanic calderas and primeval forests for any traveller intrepid enough to dare.</p>\n', 1, 'azerbaijan', 0, 1),

Today, Bosnia-Herzegovina is a country rising from the ashes, enjoying a cultural and political rejuvenation that shows no signs of slowing down.<br />\n	Nowadays swathes of magnificently beautiful back country with wide vistas of mountainous rock and thick fir forests have come to represent a land of discovery and adventure for visitors, where a veritable cascade of outdoorsy pursuits is available. If that&rsquo;s your thing, then be sure to ask your Bosnia and Herzegovina tour guide for details about white water rafting on the Neretva River, or rock climbing on the Romanija Mountain in the south.<br />\n	And what&rsquo;s more, the country has recently been touted as a viable extension of the Eastern European party trail, and with the capital of Sarajevo now accessible by day train from Budapest, the city&rsquo;s quirky clubs and lively bar scene are just waiting to be discovered.</p>\n', 1, 'bosnia-and-herzegovina', 0, 1),

Beach lovers often head to the south west coast, where some of the most built-up stretches of coastline span outwards from the capital at Bridgetown. The city itself is a great place to begin, and offers some fantastic beachside seafood dining, along with a host of bubbling nightlife joints that spill parties onto the sand after dark (don&rsquo;t leave without trying the Islander&rsquo;s famous rum punch!) .<br />\n	Further inland the undulating terrain of cliffs and caverns opens up to allow visitors a truly unique outdoors experience.

In Dutch-speaking Flanders, UNESCO-designated Brugge (&ldquo;The Venice of the North&rdquo;) and the university town Ghent take the cake as far as charm goes. Then there&rsquo;s the second-largest city in the country with the second-largest port in Europe - Antwerp - that&rsquo;s a front-runner when it comes to class.<br />\n	But no travel guide to Belgium could overlook the country&rsquo;s star: Brussels. The bilingual capital of the European Union practically rolls out the red carpet as far as diplomacy goes.

Other more remote spots like Cabo Polonio and Carmelo, still mostly unexplored by outsiders, offer a glance of more traditional Latin life, where fishermen and laid-back locals still cluster around the coffee houses and promenades.</p>\n', 1, 'uruguay', 0, 1),

Venezuela is considered one of the 20 megadiverse countries on the planet and is home to tabletop Tepuis (sandstone plateaus) that take up much of Canaima National Park, capturing the imaginations of explorers for centuries. Venezuelans are a fiery people who are fiercely proud of their culture - one that&rsquo;s continually bursting with new ideas and artforms.

Its cities seethe with the purring of mopeds, the touting of salespeople, the smells of succulent street food stalls dishing canh chua and peanut satay to boot. It&rsquo;s backcountry rises above the misty clouds in streams of rice paddy and wild jungle, all peppered by the occasional bamboo village of earthy locals with tanned and seam-crossed faces.<br />\n	City-lovers should be sure to ask their Vietnam tour guide about a route through the country that runs the gamut; from heady Hanoi in the north, with its magnificent Ha Long Bay and sprawling honorific monuments to Great Uncle Ho, to the old Saigon down south, with its shimmering high-rises and curious post-colonial feel.<br />\n	But of course no introduction to Nam&rsquo; could be complete without at least a mention of its beaches.

What&rsquo;s more, other enclaves of summertime hedonism exist away from the capital now, and guests so inclined should be sure to ask their Kosovo tour guide about the scene at Gjilan or lakeside Gjakova.<br />\n	Away from the towns, Kosovo&rsquo;s backcountry is alive with rugged mountain ranges and traditional towns, where the age old belief in unprejudiced hospitality still rings true. Indeed, if anything, the real fruits of Kosovo are to be found in its people.

It&rsquo;s a place of labyrinthine streets and geometrically adorned architecture that occupies a plain in the west of the country more than 2,000 metres above sea level.<br />\n	The country&rsquo;s western provinces also host the great Sarawat, dominating the land with rugged valleys of dusty rock. Here visitors can spy out ancient towns carved into the hills, or hike through some of the most breath-taking scenery on the whole Arabian Peninsula.

Once the richest country in Africa, Zimbabwe has seen its share of challenges since, but visitors can safely stick to the eastern region to get the best out of this destination. Tourism not only helps the local economy (which is now fuelled by the US Dollar) but is fairly navigable and an essential experience for those considering South Africa.<br />\n	The former &ldquo;Breadbasket of Africa&rdquo; was also the center of the Munhumutapa Empire, which left behind archaeological remains in the form of the ancient ruins at Great Zimbabwe, a UNESCO-designated stone city located in the scenic Eastern Highlands of the country.
